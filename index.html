        Hi. We run a PvE vanilla Ark: Survival Evolved server on the Ragnarok map.
        Obviously it has some settings tweaked so it doesn't take 166 million
        years to get your base built or creature tamed. We have active Admin
        and friendly players. Please have a read of the <a href="#rules">rules</a> and come join in.
        If you have Steam open just <a href="steam://connect/194.147.120.19:27415">click here</a>
        to join. You can also find more server details by clicking the <a href="https://arkservers.net/server/193.111.184.21:27415" target="_blank">arkservers.net</a>
        banner below. If you have time a thumbs up/comment on there would be great
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        We love to be social so come on over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/n9Pxsph" target="_blank">Discord</a>
        Server. There's group channels and you can even claim a tribe channel for your own tribe. Chat to you there.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, you wanna know all the latest news, update's, random thought's and event's. In that case
        you're in the right place. I will try and keep this as much up to date as I can. Haha, so it might get
        another update this year. Not promising anything though ;).

      <h5>30<sup>th </sup>June 2017 - Major Patch v260, Tek Trough, more server options and more fixes!</h5>
      <p>
        So Major Patch version 260 has just dropped. We have updated Neanderthal Extreme PvE server and a wild dino
        wipe has taken place. I'm not sure if anyone called for it be we are now able to craft a tek trough. It's
        a trough that has the same spoil timers as a refridgerator and is powered by the tek generator. There's also
        a remodelled Sabertooth with new animations with better gathering of pelt and chitin. Also a few new server
        options we have turned on including multiple platform saddle floors, unlimited survivor respec's and we
        have cranked the loot quality of the drops and fishing to max - for now. Check out all the
        server settings <a href="#settings">here</a> :)
        <br>
        <br>
        Full patch notes can be found
        <a href="http://ark.gg/pcnotes" target="blank">here</a>
      </p>

      <h5>22<sup>th </sup>June 2017 - Major Patch v259, Forced Survivor Restat and loads of fixes!</h5>
      <p>
        So Major Patch version 259 has just dropped. We have updated Neanderthal Extreme PvE server and a wild dino
        wipe has taken place. Upon logging in you may have noticed that your survivor level has been reset back to level 1 and you have
        been refunded all of you points. This is due to "Crafting Speed" being replaced with "Crafting Skill". Very
        little is know about this atm but essentially by adding point to the new "Crafting Skill" you stand a chance
        of crafting a better item from your Blueprints. Also fishing has been "rebalanced" so you may notice that
        any fishing rods you had may be gone.
        <br>

      <h5>18<sup>th </sup>June 2017 - Lazy Sunday Dragon Event!</h5>
      <p>
        So Lazy Sunday is here again. To take your mind off having to go to work, school or college tomorrow
        I will be at the Green Obelisk Spawning in Dragons. When you see the server broadcast announcing the start
        of the event head on over to the Green Obelisk to claim your dragon. Bear in mind these Dragons will
        despawn 20 minutes from tame so please show up naked as death is very likely.
      </p>

      <h5>17<sup>th </sup>June 2017 - Website update and Latest News...</h5>
      <p>
        So finally got around to giving the website some much needed TLC. We have a brand new Title and look. All
        of the server <a href="#settings">Settings...</a> are now updated and correct. Also added the
        <a href="#news">Latest News...</a>
        section. I guess if you are reading this you have already found that particular section :)

          <span class="hl">*</span> Decay timers are on. These timers are there purely as an aid to the
          Admins. This allows us to remove abandoned structures and creatures.
          These timers are certainly not there for players to sit on and swoop
          in the second they run out so you can claim their creature's or loot
          their storage's.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want you to have fun. Tame your own creature's and find your own loot to stash away.
          If you're new or just not able to tame a certain creature, ask in chat.
          Everyone is friendly and if they are not in the middle of something they
          will help you out with what ever you need. That goes for us Admin too.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">NOTE:</span> If these timers get abused we will turn them off forcing us to make a judgement calls
          on whether a certain structure or creature is abandoned. This could lead to
          tribes being wiped prematurely. Hehe, I said premature ;)
